# Lesson 1

The goal is to build a poker playing program.

We need to have an idea about the problem domain, the main concepts. In the case
of a poker playing game, the major concepts are 

- cards (which have numbers symbols on them)
- hand (a collection of cards)
- suit (the symbol on the card eg hearts, diamonds, clubs, spacdes)
- rank (where the card sits in the heirarchy of value, eg A > K > Q ....)
- hand rank (how do you value the whole hand)	
	- n-kind (how many of the same rank eg 2 aces or 3 10's)
	- straight (the hand are all sequential eg 8,9,10,J,Q) 
	- flush (all the same suit)

These concepts need to be modelled and represented in the computer.
